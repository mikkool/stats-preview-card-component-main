## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned how to use JSON and more about css styling. It was hard but I managed to pull it off. :)

### Continued development

I will focus more on using JSON and practice more in manipulating DOM. It's really fun as I learn new stuff.

### Useful resources
I have been googling most of the stuff e.g. using JSON, manipulating DOM and grid layouts in CSS
